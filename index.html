        Approximately 1.9 million years ago I discovered fire. At first, I just used it to melt stuff for fun.  Then I realized that you could cook food and keep warm with it.

      </nav>
      <p>While we didn't call it the neolithic era back then, it was during this time about 11,000 years ago that I came up with the idea for the wheel.  It's really caught on since.</p>

      <p>This one is still really a work in progress but I'm listing it in the completed projects because before I invented agriculture we were really just hunting around and gathering stuff for most of the day.  I found that if I planted stuff and then came back later to pick it that I could spend more time inventing stuff.</p>

      <p>A more recent project I worked on independently was for a device that built on my earlier invention of fire and transformed the energy into kinetic energy. While initially I really just wanted to make a back massager I found that it was good at powering machines that utilized another of my earlier invetions, the wheel. Incidentally, this was the first project I obtained a patent for.</p>
