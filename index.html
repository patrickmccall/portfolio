    <!-- Fire -->
    <h3>Fire</h3>
    <p>Approximately 1.9 million years ago I discovered fire. At first, I just used it to melt stuff for fun.  Then I realized that you could cook food and keep warm with it.</p>
    <!-- The Wheel -->
    <h3>The Wheel</h3>
    <p>While we didn't call it the neolithic era back then, it was during this time about 11,000 years ago that I came up with the idea for the wheel.  It's really caught on since.</p>
    <!-- Agriculture -->
    <h3>Agriculture</h3>
    <p></p>
    <!-- Animal Husbandry -->
    <!-- Steam Engine -->
    <h3>Steam Engine</h3>
    <p>A more recent project I worked on independently was for a device</p>

    <h2>Works in Progress</h2>
    <h3>Domestication of Cats</h3>
    <p>Admitedly, this project is taking longer than I expected.  I started working on it approximately 6,000 years ago.</p>
